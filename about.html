      <p>The Moon is Earth’s only natural satellite and the fifth-largest moon in the Solar System. It has a diameter of about 3,474 kilometers and a surface characterized by craters, mountains, and vast plains of solidified lava called maria. The Moon has a weak atmosphere, known as an exosphere, which cannot support life. Its gravitational influence is responsible for the tides on Earth and plays a role in stabilizing the planet’s axial tilt. The Moon completes one orbit around Earth approximately every 27.3 days, resulting in its synchronous rotation, which causes the same side to always face Earth. Geological evidence indicates that the Moon formed about 4.5 billion years ago, likely from debris resulting from a massive collision between Earth and a Mars-sized body. The Moon’s surface temperatures vary drastically, ranging from extremely hot during the day to extremely cold at night, due to the lack of a significant atmosphere.</p>
