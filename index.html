    <p>Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only known celestial body to support life. It has a roughly spherical shape with an equatorial diameter of about 12,742 kilometers and is composed of a solid inner core, a molten outer core, a viscous mantle, and a thin crust. About 71% of Earth’s surface is covered by water, primarily in the form of oceans, which play a crucial role in regulating climate and supporting ecosystems. The planet’s atmosphere, composed mainly of nitrogen and oxygen, protects life by filtering harmful solar radiation and maintaining surface temperatures suitable for life. Earth experiences dynamic geological processes, including plate tectonics, volcanic activity, and erosion, which continuously reshape its surface. Its biosphere hosts millions of species, creating complex ecological interactions that sustain global biodiversity. Earth orbits the Sun once every 365.25 days, giving rise to seasonal variations that influence weather patterns and the distribution of life.
